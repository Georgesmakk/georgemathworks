## About Me::

Young versatile and goal oriented

## Education::

Bachelor Of Science (Hons) In Applied Mathematics

## About Maths::

The art of logical ideas which when knit correctly with the correct objectives can give a variety of insights which lead to intuitive decision making.

## Idea::

To disseminate the knowledge acquired in pure maths and statistics via face to face and online-classes with the view of reaching out to many who are challenged and some limited by different obstacles . A lesson done once can be visited again several times with the hope of eliminating negativity towards the subject and erasing doubt on some concepts.
